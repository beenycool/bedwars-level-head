## General Information
BedWars Levelhead is a Minecraft mod for the Hypixel Network (`mc.hypixel.net`) that displays a player's BedWars star above their head while you are in BedWars lobbies or matches. The mod no longer includes any other Levelhead functionality—only BedWars stars remain.

## Commands
* `/levelhead` — Shows a short help message explaining how to configure the mod.
* `/levelhead apikey <key>` — Stores your Hypixel API key so the mod can fetch BedWars statistics. Dashes are optional, and you can also use `/levelhead apikey clear` to remove the stored key.
* `/levelhead clearapikey` — Alias for clearing the stored Hypixel API key from `config/bedwars-level-head.cfg`.
* `/levelhead reload` — Cancels active fetches, clears cached BedWars stars, and re-requests data for nearby players.

## Configuration
Display settings such as header text, colors, and offsets are stored in `config/levelhead.json`. The mod keeps the existing file format so you can copy settings from previous installations or edit the JSON manually.
