## 2025-05-15 - Double Serialization in Redis Cache
**Learning:** I discovered that `backend/src/services/statsCache.ts` was stringifying the `payload` object BEFORE adding it to the cache entry wrapper, which was then stringified again. This resulted in double serialization (string inside string), wasting CPU cycles and bytes (escaped quotes). Interestingly, `backend/src/services/redis.ts` already had the optimized implementation, but `statsCache.ts` (which is specific to player stats) re-implemented it inefficiently.
**Action:** When working with Redis or any storage wrapper, always check if the wrapper handles serialization. If so, pass objects directly. Also, look for "parallel" implementations of similar logic in the codebase (`statsCache.ts` vs `redis.ts`) as they often diverge in quality.
